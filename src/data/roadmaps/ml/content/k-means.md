# k-means:
       I love working on recommendation engines. Whenever I encounter any recommendation engine on a website, I can’t wait to break it down and understand how it works. It’s one of the many great things about being a data scientist! Artificial Intelligence has revolutionized how we approach data analysis and has led to the development of powerful algorithms such as k-means clustering. K-means clustering, a part of the unsupervised learning family in AI, is used to group similar data points together in a process known as clustering.
