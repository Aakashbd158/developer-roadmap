# Sampling
 Sampling means selecting the group that you will actually collect data from in your research.Sampling is a technique of selecting individual members or a subset of the population to make statistical inferences from them and estimate the characteristics of the whole population. Different sampling methods are widely used by researchers in market research so that they do not need to research the entire population to collect actionable insights.

# Types of Sampling
 Sampling in market action research is of two types – probability sampling and non-probability sampling. Let’s take a closer look at thestwo methods of sampling.

# Probability sampling 
Probability sampling is a sampling technique where a researcher selects a few criteria and chooses members of a population randomly. All the members have an equal opportunity to participate in the sample with this selection parameter.

  ## Types of Probability Sampling
   Probability sampling is a technique in which researchers choose samples from a larger population based on the theory of probability. This sampling method considers every member of the population and forms samples based on a fixed process.

  ### Simple random sampling
   One of the best probability sampling techniques that helps in saving time and resources is the Simple Random Sampling method.

  ### Cluster sampling
   Cluster sampling is a method where the researchers divide the entire population into sections or clusters representing a population. Clusters are identified and included in a sample based on demographic parameters like age, sex, location, etc.

  ### Systematic sampling
   Researchers use the systematic sampling method to choose the sample members of a population at regular intervals. It requires selecting a starting point for the sample and sample size that can be repeated at regular intervals.

  ### Stratified random sampling
   Stratified random sampling is a method in which the researcher divides the population into smaller groups that don’t overlap but represent the entire population. While sampling, these groups can be organized, and then draw a sample from each group separately.

# Uses of probability sampling
There are multiple uses of probability sampling:

  ## Reduce Sample Bias
     Using the probability sampling method, the bias in the sample derived from a population is negligible to non-existent. The sample selection mainly depicts the researcher’s understanding and inference. Probability sampling leads to higher-quality data collection as the sample appropriately represents the population.

  ## Diverse Population
     When the population is vast and diverse, it is essential to have adequate representation so that the data is not skewed toward one demographic. For example, suppose Square would like to understand the people that could make their point-of-sale devices.

  ## Create an Accurate Sample
     Probability sampling helps the researchers plan and create an accurate sample. This helps to obtain well-defined data
# Non-probability sampling:
 In non-probability sampling, the researcher randomly chooses members for research. This sampling method is not a fixed or predefined selection process. This makes it difficult for all population elements to have equal opportunities to be included in a sample.

  ## Types of non-probability sampling with examples
   The non-probability method is a sampling method that involves a collection of feedback based on a researcher or statistician’s sample selection capabilities and not on a fixed selection process. In most situations, the output of a survey conducted with a non-probable sample leads to skewed results, which may not represent the desired target population. But, there are situations, such as the preliminary stages of research or cost constraints for conducting research, where non-probability sampling will be much more useful than the other type.
   Four types of non-probability sampling explain the purpose of this sampling method in a better manner:
   
   ### Convenience sampling
     This method depends on the ease of access to subjects such as surveying customers at a mall or passers-by on a busy street. It is usually termed as convenience sampling because of the researcher’s ease of carrying it out and getting in touch with the subjects.

   ### Judgmental or purposive sampling
     Judgmental or purposive samples are formed at the researcher’s discretion. Researchers purely consider the purpose of the study, along with the understanding of the target audience.

   ### Snowball sampling
     Snowball sampling is a sampling method that researchers apply when the subjects are difficult to trace. For example, surveying shelterless people or illegal immigrants will be extremely challenging. In such cases, using the snowball theory, researchers can track a few categories to interview and derive results.

   ### Quota sampling
     In Quota sampling, members in this sampling technique selection happens based on a pre-set standard. In this case, as a sample is formed based on specific attributes, the created sample will have the same qualities found in the total population. It is a rapid method of collecting samples.

  ## Uses of non-probability sampling
   Non-probability sampling is used for the following

   ### Create a hypothesis
    Researchers use the non-probability sampling method to create an assumption when limited to no prior information is available. This method helps with the immediate return of data and builds a base for further research.
   
   ### Exploratory research
    Researchers use this sampling technique widely when conducting qualitative research, pilot studies, or exploratory research.

   ### Budget and time constraints
    The non-probability method when there are budget and time constraints, and some preliminary data must be collected. Since the survey design is not rigid, it is easier to pick respondents randomly and have them take the survey or questionnaire.
