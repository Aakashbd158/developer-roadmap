# Sampling
 Sampling means selecting the group that you will actually collect data from in your research.Sampling is a technique of selecting individual members or a subset of the population to make statistical inferences from them and estimate the characteristics of the whole population. 
# Types of Sampling
 Sampling in market action research is of two types – probability sampling and non-probability sampling. Let’s take a closer look at thestwo methods of sampling.

# Probability sampling 
Probability sampling is a sampling technique where a researcher selects a few criteria and chooses members of a population randomly. All the members have an equal opportunity to participate in the sample with this selection parameter.

  ## Types of Probability Sampling
   Probability sampling is a technique in which researchers choose samples from a larger population based on the theory of probability. This sampling method considers every member of the population and forms samples based on a fixed process.

  ### Simple random sampling
   One of the best probability sampling techniques that helps in saving time and resources is the Simple Random Sampling method.

  ### Cluster sampling
   Cluster sampling is a method where the researchers divide the entire population into sections or clusters representing a population. Clusters are identified and included in a sample based on demographic parameters like age, sex, location, etc.

  ### Systematic sampling
   Researchers use the systematic sampling method to choose the sample members of a population at regular intervals. It requires selecting a starting point for the sample and sample size that can be repeated at regular intervals.

  ### Stratified random sampling
   Stratified random sampling is a method in which the researcher divides the population into smaller groups that don’t overlap but represent the entire population. 

# Non-probability sampling:
 In non-probability sampling, the researcher randomly chooses members for research. This sampling method is not a fixed or predefined selection process. 
 
  ## Types of non-probability sampling with examples
   The non-probability method is a sampling method that involves a collection of feedback based on a researcher or statistician’s sample selection capabilities and not on a fixed selection process.
   
   ### Convenience sampling
     This method depends on the ease of access to subjects such as surveying customers at a mall or passers-by on a busy street. It is usually termed as convenience sampling because of the researcher’s ease of carrying it out and getting in touch with the subjects.

   ### Judgmental or purposive sampling
     Judgmental or purposive samples are formed at the researcher’s discretion. Researchers purely consider the purpose of the study, along with the understanding of the target audience.

   ### Snowball sampling
     Snowball sampling is a sampling method that researchers apply when the subjects are difficult to trace. For example, surveying shelterless people or illegal immigrants will be extremely challenging.
   ### Quota sampling
     In Quota sampling, members in this sampling technique selection happens based on a pre-set standard. In this case, as a sample is formed based on specific attributes, the created sample will have the same qualities found in the total population. It is a rapid method of collecting samples.
