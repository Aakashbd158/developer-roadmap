Add Feedforward NN resources 

#Definition Feedforward NN resources :

A feedforward neural network (also known as a multilayer perceptron) is a type of artificial neural network in which the connections between the neurons do not form a cycle. 
The network is organized into layers, with each layer consisting of multiple neurons.
