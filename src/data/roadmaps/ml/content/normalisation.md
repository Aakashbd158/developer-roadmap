Normalisation:
     Normalization is a process of organizing data in a database to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity. It is a technique used to minimize data duplication and ensure that data is stored logically and efficiently.  Normalization involves dividing larger tables into smaller, more manageable tables and defining relationships between them. This helps to reduce data redundancy and improve data consistency, which leads to better overall data quality.  The normalization process typically involves several steps, known as normal forms. The most commonly used normal forms are:
        1.First normal form (1NF): This requires that each table has a primary key and that all data is atomic (i.e., not further divisible).
        
        2.Second normal form (2NF): This requires that all non-key attributes are functionally dependent on the primary key.

        3.Third normal form (3NF): This requires that all non-key attributes are not transitively dependent on the primary key.

    There are additional normal forms beyond 3NF, but they are less commonly used. Overall, normalization is an important aspect of database design and helps to ensure that data is stored in a logical and efficient manner.
