# Normalisation:
     Normalization is a process of organizing data in a database to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity. It is a technique used to minimize data duplication and ensure that data is stored logically and efficiently.  Normalization involves dividing larger tables into smaller, more manageable tables and defining relationships between them. This helps to reduce data redundancy and improve data consistency, which leads to better overall data quality.
